# Project Description: Analysis of Theses and Dissertations by Year, Report Type, and Program
**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to organize and analyze data on theses and dissertations submitted between 2020 and 2024. The analysis focuses on the type of report (thesis, dissertation, DNP report) and the academic program (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering). The insights derived from this analysis will be presented to the Graduate Council to inform decision-making and strategic planning.

**Data Source:**
The data for this analysis is extracted from the first tab of an Excel worksheet. The relevant data columns include:
* Posted Year: The year the report was posted.
* Document Type: The type of report (thesis, dissertation, DNP report).
* Program: The academic program, identified using column HE (publication) in the spreadsheet.

**Methodology:**
***A. Data Preparation:***
* Load the data from the Excel worksheet.
* Filter and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Group the data by year, document type, and program.

***B. Data Analysis:***
* Calculate the number of theses, dissertations, and DNP reports submitted each year from 2020 to 2024.
* Categorize the reports by academic program.
* Organize the data into a structured table for clear and concise presentation.

***C. Visualization:***
* Create a bar plot to visually represent the distribution of document types by year.
* Highlight trends and patterns in the submission of theses, dissertations, and DNP reports across different programs.
* Use Plotly to generate an interactive graph for detailed exploration of the data.

***D. Presentation:***
* Prepare a PowerPoint slide summarizing the key findings.
* Insert the table and graph into the slide to provide a visual representation of the data.
* Share the presentation with the Graduate Council to support their review and discussion.

***Deliverables:***
*i. Data Table:*
*A comprehensive table listing the number of theses, dissertations, and DNP reports by year and program.

*ii. Graph:*
* An interactive bar plot showing the document types by year, color-coded by program.

*iii. PowerPoint Slide:*
* A slide containing the table and graph, ready for presentation to the Graduate Council.

***E. Tools and Technologies:***
* Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Pandas: For data processing and organization.
* Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
* Excel: As the data source.
* PowerPoint: For creating the presentation slide.
